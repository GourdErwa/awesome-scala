    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>
        According to the SLS (&sect;6.16), &quot;the type of a conditional
        expression is the weak least upper bound of the types of [its two
        branches]&quot;. This is true even if only one of the branches can ever be
        chosen. In general, the weak least upper bound is the least common
        supertype of the types of the two branches, but if both branches return
        <em>numeric</em> types, as here, a different relationship is used to
        determine the overall type.
    </p>
    <p>
        This relationship is defined by &quot;weak conformance&quot;
        (SLS &sect;3.5.3), Scala's definition of the ranking of the primitive
        number types. These have a hierarchy, even though they are not sub- or
        supertypes of each other. In this hierarchy, <tt>Float</tt> ranks higher
        than <tt>Char</tt> (also a numeric type), so the overall type of
        the <tt>if</tt> statement is <tt>Float</tt>. The numeric value of the
        character '5' is the value of its ASCII representation, 53, or 53.0 as a
        <tt>Float</tt>.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, '5' is only treated as a <tt>Float</tt> in the <em>second</em>
        <tt>println</tt> statement, since the compiler needs to know the type of
        the conditional expression in order to compile the subsequent call to
        method <tt>toString</tt>. In the case of the first <tt>println</tt>
        statement, the compiler never needs to determine the type of the
        <tt>if</tt> statement, because <tt>println</tt> takes an argument of type
        <tt>Any</tt>. So it can &quot; blindly&quot; pass on the value returned
        by the <tt>else</tt> branch, i.e. the character '5'.
    </p>
